# Selenium Generic Methods (Framework Independent)

We all know, Itâ€™s always good to have reusable methods in our framework. Creating methods for every action to be performed 
on a webpage is not so easy while automating using Selenium. In order to suppress, we can create a class where we could store 
all the methods which are useful for our project. So that we can call these methods wherever we need them. This would be so 
simple to call these reusable methods.

I just created these methods to make you understand, just add them in base class and extend base class in your existing class. Happy testing :-)
